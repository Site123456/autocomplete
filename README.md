This offline autocomplete AI is built using Python and designed to function without an internet connection once initialized. It uses a set of basic functions to provide core autocomplete capabilities. While it handles straightforward tasks effectively, its performance is limited by the simplicity of its underlying model. For users who require more advanced AI features, enhancing the system with additional data sources and training more complex machine learning models is recommended. These upgrades would significantly improve its predictive accuracy and expand its range of potential applications. Note that the modelâ€™s size can vary depending on the dataset, and in some cases, the processed files may exceed 10GB.

How to use:
Open the system in any Python-supported environment.
