# Autocomplete AI - Overview and Usage Instructions

This **Autocomplete AI** is built using Python and designed to operate entirely offline once initialized. It relies on a set of core functions to provide basic autocomplete capabilities, making it suitable for straightforward tasks. However, due to the simplicity of the model, its performance is best suited for basic autocomplete scenarios.

For users who require more advanced AI features—such as improved prediction accuracy or broader use cases—it is recommended to enhance the system by incorporating additional data sources or integrating more complex machine learning models. These improvements would significantly enhance the AI’s predictive power and expand its potential applications. Keep in mind that the model’s size can vary depending on the dataset, and in some cases, the processed files may exceed 10GB.

## How to Use:

### 1. Setup: 
- Ensure you have a Python-supported environment set up to run the system.
- Download and install the necessary dependencies to initialize the AI model.

### 2. Running the AI: 
- Launch the Python script or application containing the offline autocomplete system.
- Follow the setup instructions in the documentation to initialize the model.

### 3. Using the Autocomplete Feature: 
- Once the model is initialized, input your request in the following format:
  
[your IP]::8000/complete?Prompt=[your prompt]


The AI will then provide autocomplete suggestions based on its trained dataset.

## Important Notes:

- **Content Filtering**: 
- This AI does not include content filtering, which means it may generate unwanted or inappropriate results. Please exercise caution when using it in sensitive contexts.
 
- **CPU-based System**: 
- The AI is designed to run on CPU, not GPU. Therefore, it is not suitable for high-demand tasks or for use in online environments or published applications, where performance and scalability are critical.

## Performance Considerations:
- The AI’s performance is limited by its underlying model, and it may struggle with more complex or large-scale tasks.
- Users who need advanced features should consider enhancing the model with additional data or more powerful machine learning techniques.

By following these steps, you can fully utilize the AI’s autocomplete capabilities while being aware of its limitations. Feel free to modify the code to better suit your specific needs and requirements.
